# Phase 3 Step 3.2 Implementation Summary: Metadata Extractor

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 3 Step 3.2 from the BUILD_PLAN.md: **"Metadata Extractor"** - a comprehensive system for extracting metadata from TypeScript test files generated by the .apicize export process. This enables bidirectional conversion between .apicize files and TypeScript test suites while preserving all request, group, and file-level metadata.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Core MetadataExtractor Class Implementation
**Location**: `/project/tools/apicize-tools/packages/lib/src/parser/metadata-extractor.ts`

Created a robust `MetadataExtractor` class with comprehensive metadata parsing capabilities:

#### Extraction Methods
- `extractFromFile(filePath, options)` - Extract metadata from TypeScript files on disk
- `extractFromContent(content, options)` - Extract metadata from TypeScript content strings
- `extractAndValidate(data)` - Extract and validate with error throwing for critical failures

#### Configuration Options
- `strictMode` - Fail if no metadata blocks are found
- `includeWarnings` - Include warning messages in results for duplicate IDs and other issues
- `validateJson` - Enable/disable JSON schema validation of extracted metadata

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error reporting for malformed JSON, missing files, and invalid metadata
- Graceful handling of missing metadata blocks vs. critical extraction failures
- Custom `MetadataExtractionError` exception class for validation failures
- Detailed line number reporting for parsing errors

### 2. Metadata Comment Block Support
The extractor supports three types of metadata comment blocks as defined in the BUILD_PLAN:

#### File-Level Metadata
```typescript
/* @apicize-file-metadata
{
  "version": 1.0,
  "source": "demo.apicize",
  "exportDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
@apicize-file-metadata-end */
```

#### Request-Level Metadata
```typescript
/* @apicize-request-metadata
{
  "id": "create-user-request",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": [...],
  "body": {...},
  "timeout": 30000
}
@apicize-request-metadata-end */
```

#### Group-Level Metadata
```typescript
/* @apicize-group-metadata
{
  "id": "user-group-456",
  "name": "User Operations",
  "execution": "SEQUENTIAL"
}
@apicize-group-metadata-end */
```

### 3. Advanced Test Code Extraction
The extractor includes sophisticated test code parsing that:

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies Mocha/Chai test patterns: `it('test name', () => {})` and `test('test name', () => {})`
- Handles complex nested brace structures with proper matching
- Accounts for parentheses within test code that could interfere with brace counting

#### Flexible Code Boundaries
- Searches up to 20 lines after metadata blocks to find associated test code
- Handles complex TypeScript files with imports, exports, and nested describe blocks
- Provides fallback behavior for incomplete or malformed test blocks

#### Test Code Preservation
- Maintains original formatting and structure of test code
- Preserves comments, whitespace, and complex JavaScript/TypeScript constructs
- Handles template literals, arrow functions, and modern ES6+ syntax

### 4. Helper Methods for Data Access
The extractor provides extensive utility methods for working with extracted metadata:

#### Metadata Traversal
- `getAllRequests(metadata)` - Flatten and return all request metadata from all sources
- `getAllGroups(metadata)` - Flatten and return all group metadata (handles nesting)
- `findMetadataById(metadata, id)` - Find specific metadata by ID across all types

#### Statistics and Analysis
- `getMetadataStats(metadata)` - Generate comprehensive statistics about extracted metadata
- Duplicate ID detection and reporting
- Test code coverage analysis (requests with vs. without test code)

#### Data Validation
- JSON structure validation for all metadata blocks
- Cross-references and consistency checking
- Warning collection for non-critical issues

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems
**Location**: `/project/tools/apicize-tools/packages/lib/src/parser/index.ts`

- Updated parser module exports to include all metadata extraction functionality
- Maintains consistency with existing `ApicizeParser` patterns and interfaces
- Uses the same TypeScript strict mode settings and error handling approaches
- Follows established project conventions for class design and method naming

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Location**: `/project/tools/apicize-tools/packages/lib/src/parser/metadata-extractor.test.ts`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Comment Block Parsing**: Regex-based approach for flexibility with different comment styles and whitespace
2. **JSON Validation**: Optional validation to support both development and production use cases
3. **Error Categorization**: Separate handling for critical errors vs. warnings for better user experience
4. **Test Code Extraction**: Advanced brace matching algorithm for accurate code boundary detection

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient line-by-line parsing with minimal memory overhead
- Lazy evaluation of optional features (warnings, validation)
- Early termination for critical errors to avoid unnecessary processing
- Minimal object creation during parsing operations

### Error Recovery Strategies
- Graceful degradation for partial metadata extraction
- Detailed error context for debugging and troubleshooting
- Preservation of successfully parsed metadata even when some blocks fail
- Clear distinction between recoverable warnings and critical failures
