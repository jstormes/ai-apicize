# Phase 8.1: Package Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 8.1 successfully configured the Apicize tools packages for npm distribution. This phase focused on setting up proper package configurations, build scripts, documentation, and ensuring the packages can be installed and used both locally and from npm registry.

## Completed Implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Step 8.1: Package Configuration âœ…

- Verified declaration files (.d.ts) are generated correctly
- Configured declaration maps for better IDE support
- Set up composite builds for monorepo optimization
- Ensured all type definitions are included in packages

#### 4. **npm Ignore Files** âœ…
- Created .npmignore files for both lib and tools packages
- Excluded source files, test files, and development artifacts
- Only distribute compiled JavaScript and declaration files
- Excluded IDE files, logs, and temporary files

#### 5. **Documentation with Badges** âœ…
- Created comprehensive README files for all packages
- Added npm version, license, and download badges
- Included quick start guides and usage examples
- Added API documentation for lib package
- Created feature lists and installation instructions

#### 6. **LICENSE Configuration** âœ…
- Created MIT LICENSE file in root
- Copied LICENSE to each package directory
- Included license information in package.json files

#### 7. **CHANGELOG Documentation** âœ…
- Created CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Documented initial release features
- Set up structure for future version tracking

## Technical Details

### Package Structure

#### @apicize/tools Package
```json
{
  "name": "@apicize/tools",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "CLI tools for working with .apicize API test files",
  "bin": {
    "apicize": "dist/cli.js"
  },
  "preferGlobal": true,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16.0.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  },
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
  }
}
```

#### @apicize/lib Package
```json
{
  "name": "@apicize/lib",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Core library for Apicize tools",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
  }
}
```

### Build Pipeline

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Source TypeScript â†’ JavaScript + Declarations
   - Source maps for debugging
   - Composite builds for incremental compilation

2. **Package Creation**
   - `npm pack` creates distributable tarballs
   - Only necessary files included via .npmignore
   - README, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG included

3. **Local Testing**
   - Test installation in isolated environment
   - Verify CLI executable works
   - Check all dependencies are correctly declared

### npm Scripts Added

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "npm run clean && npm run build && npm run test",
    "prepare": "npm run build",
    "version": "npm run lint && git add -A",
    "postversion": "git push && git push --tags",
    "pack:test": "npm pack --workspaces",
    "install:test:local": "cd /tmp && npm init -y && npm install file:${PWD}/apicize-*.tgz",
    "publish:dry": "npm publish --dry-run --workspaces",
    "publish:packages": "npm publish --workspaces --access public"
  }
}
```

## Package Sizes

After optimization and proper configuration:

| Package | Packed Size | Unpacked Size | Files |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| @apicize/tools | 22.6 kB | 96.0 kB | 34 |
| @apicize/lib | 118.6 kB | 625.2 kB | 132 |
| @apicize/examples | 23.6 kB | 117.1 kB | 16 (private) |
